## About this Repository
This repository contains one single jupyter notebook called Tasks.ipynb which contains my solutions to four tasks that were assigned throughout the semester. Each task is contained within its own section of the notebook with the references I called upon for each task listed at the end of each section. 

The assignment brief is contained in this repository in a document called assessment.pdf
