The closer the starting value is to the square root, the less iterations will be required to come to the result. This starting value also known as the seed value should be a positive number between 1 and the value that we are trying to calculate the square root of. In my case, this would be a value between 1 and 2 as I am tasked with finding the square root of 2.

    "#### Contingency table explained\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of this task I have been provided a contingency table of data. A contingency table is a type of table in a matrix that displays the frequency distribution of variables. They provide a picture of the interrelation between two variables [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example contingeny table shown above [1] that I will work with in this task there are four neighbourhoods - A, B, C and D in a city with a population of 1,000,000 people. A random sample of 650 residents is taken and their occupation has been recorded into 3 categories - white collar, blue collar and no collar.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 categorical variables in this data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "* neighbourhood\n",
    "* occupation\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis is that each person's neighbourhood is independent of their occupation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "In inferential statistics the null hypothesis is a general statement or default position that there is no difference between two measured phenomena or that two samples derive from the same general population [3]. In the case of the contingency table of data in this task the null hypothesis is that categorical variables neighbourhood and occupation are independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have been tasked with verifying using Scipy.stats that the Chi-squared value of this contingency table of data is approximately 24.6 and also to calculate the associated p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Chi-squared test?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Chi-squared test is a statistical hypothesis that is valid to perform when the test statistic is chi-squared distributed under the null hypothesis [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson's chi-squared test is used to determine whether there is a statistically signifigant difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more categories of a contingency table [1]. In the case of this task, is there a difference between the frequency of occupations recorded per neighbourhood in the contingency table of data compared to what you would expect to see based on the null hypothesis that each person's neighbourhood is indepedent of their occupation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson's chi-squared statistical hypothesis is an example of a test for independence between categorical variables [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chi-Squared test in summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Categorical variables can be summarised using a contingency table. \n",
    "* The chi-squared test is a test of independence between categorical variables in a contingency table.\n",
    "* The variables are considered independent if the observed and expected frequencies are similiar.\n",
    "* A chi-squared test can be used in this case to determine whether or not there is a relationship between the neighbourhood a person lives in and their occupation, or in other words do we accept or reject the null hypothesis.\n",
