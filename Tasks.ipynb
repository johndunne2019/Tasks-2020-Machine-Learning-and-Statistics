    "Every number has two square roots, a negative and non-negative square root. The principal (non-negative) square root of most numbers is an irrational number. As a result of this, the decimal expansion of a square root can only be calculated to a precision [1].

    "An iterative approach to finding the square root of a number involves finding a suitable starting value followed by refinement until a termination criteria is met [1]. In plainer terms, to find the square root of a number 2, I would need to start with a suitable starting value and refine until we come to the closest approximation for the square root. The closer the starting value is to the square root, the less iterations will be required to come to the result. This starting value also known as the seed value should be a positive number between 1 and the value that we are trying to calculate the square root of. In my case, this would be a value between 1 and 2 as I am tasked with finding the square root of 2. The reason we have to start with a value in this range is that the square root of any number must fall into this range between 1 and that number.\n",
